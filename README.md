Restaurant Sales Dashboard Analysis in Excel
Project Overview:

This project involves creating an interactive and dynamic Excel dashboard using a restaurant sales dataset to analyze various aspects of sales performance, item popularity, customer preferences, and time-based trends. The goal is to provide actionable insights that help in decision-making and to allow users to easily explore the data for meaningful patterns and trends.

The dashboard provides comprehensive views of the dataset with a focus on key metrics like sales revenue by category, order volume by time, and performance comparison of top-selling items across different time periods.

Key Features and Insights:
1. Sales Revenue by Category: The dashboard calculates the total sales revenue for each category of menu items, providing insight into the financial performance of different product categories.

2. Daily Order Count: A dynamic chart tracks the number of orders placed each day, helping identify patterns and trends in customer activity.

3. Most Popular Menu Item: The dashboard identifies the most frequently ordered menu item, offering valuable insight into customer preferences.

4. Total Revenue by Menu Items: A detailed breakdown of the total revenue generated by each menu item, helping to prioritize focus on the most profitable items.

5. Revenue Comparison by Category Over Time: The dashboard allows users to compare the revenue generated by different categories of menu items across various months, helping to understand seasonal trends and performance.

6. Average Number of Items Per Order: This analysis reveals how many items are typically ordered per transaction, offering insights into customer buying behavior.

7. Order Volumes by Time of Day: The dashboard visualizes how order volumes fluctuate throughout the day, identifying peak times and helping optimize staffing and inventory.

8. Weekday vs Weekend Sales Trends: By comparing sales performance across weekdays and weekends, the dashboard highlights different customer behavior patterns, assisting in better operational planning.

9. Category Performance by Month: A dynamic chart that shows how sales for each menu category vary across different months, offering insights into seasonal product popularity.

10. Top 5 Menu Items Comparison: The dashboard allows users to compare the sales performance of the top 5 most popular menu items, providing detailed insights into which products drive the highest revenue.

Data Cleaning Process:
Before performing any analysis, the dataset was cleaned to ensure data quality:

Duplicates Removal: All duplicate entries were removed to ensure accurate analysis.
Null Values Handling: Applied suitable processes to handle missing data efficiently, ensuring completeness in the dataset.

Tools Used:
Microsoft Excel: The dashboard is built entirely within Excel, utilizing features like Pivot Tables, Charts, Slicers, and Power Query for data transformation and visualization.
Power Query: Used for cleaning and preparing the dataset before analysis, including handling duplicates and missing values.
Formulas & Conditional Formatting: Used to calculate key metrics and highlight important data trends.
